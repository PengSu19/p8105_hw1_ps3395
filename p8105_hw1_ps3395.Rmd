## Problem 1
### Preparatory work

#### library packages

```{r message=FALSE}
#library the packages
library(moderndive)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
```

#### Load the data

```{r P1}
#loading dataset
data("early_january_weather")
tail(early_january_weather, 3)
```

#### Dataset description

Above table shows the last 3 rows of the dataset *'early_january_weather'* which represent the hourly meterological data for EWR for January 2013 with `r ncol(early_january_weather)` columns and `r nrow(early_january_weather)` rows.

The *'early_january_weather'* dataset includes 15 variables such as:

*  `origin`: The Weather station, in this dataset, it only contains `EWR`.
*  `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`: The recording time.
*  `temp`: The temperature in F, and the average temperature is `r round(mean(early_january_weather$temp),2)` (round to 2 decimal)

#### Scatterplot

Plot a scatterplot of `temp` and `time_hour`, colored by `humid` variable using `ggplot()`.

```{r plot}
#plot scatter_plot for temp and time_hour
scatter_plot <- 
  ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(time_hour, temp, color = humid)) +
  geom_point()+
  xlab("Time_Hour")+
  ylab("Temperature")+
  theme_bw()
```

#### Scatter plot description

From scatter plot of temperature and time hour shows below, it is noticeable that although there are significant and persistent fluctuations in the temperature measured by weather station in January, the overall trend for temperature is gradually increasing over the time, and peaking after January 14 which reaches `r max(early_january_weather$temp)` degrees Fahrenheit. Meanwhile, the relative humidity is relatively high from about January 12 to 14, which is shown as a light blue dots in Figure 1.

saving plot

```{r message=FALSE}
#saving the plot to png.
ggsave("scatterplot.png",scatter_plot)
```

```{r scatter, echo=FALSE, fig.cap= "Figure 1",fig.align='center',out.width='60%'}
#import the plot
knitr::include_graphics("scatterplot.png")
```

## Problem 2

### Creating dataframe

Creating a data frame comprised of numeric, logical, character and factor variables.

```{r}
#creat the data frame
sample_df <- tibble(
  num_random = rnorm(10, mean = 0, sd = 1),
  log_ver = num_random > 0,
  cha_ver = c("A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I","J"),
  factor_ver = factor(c("large","large","large","large","mid","mid","mid","small","small","small"),levels = c("large", "mid", "small"))
)
```

#### Taking the mean of each variable in dataframe using `mean()` function.

`mean()` function works with numeric and logical arguments, which are `num_random` and `log_ver` in `sample_df`.

```{r}
#calculate the mean
mean_num = mean(pull(sample_df,num_random))
mean_log = mean(pull(sample_df,log_ver))
mean_num
mean_log
```

`mean()` function does not works with arguments that are not numeric or logical and will return NA as result. Such as `cha_ver` and `factor_ver` these two variables in the dataframe.

```{r}
#calculate the mean
mean_cha = mean(pull(sample_df,cha_ver))
mean_factor = mean(pull(sample_df,factor_ver))
mean_cha
mean_factor
```

#### Explicitly convert variables

Using `as.numeric` function to convert the logical, character, and factor variables.

```{r results='hide', warning=FALSE}
#convert variables to numeric
log_ver_N = as.numeric(pull(sample_df, log_ver))
cha_ver_N = as.numeric(pull(sample_df, cha_ver))
factor_ver_N = as.numeric(pull(sample_df, factor_ver))
```

After applying `as.numeric` function to convert the logical, character, and factor variables, as logical variables are Boolean, it can be convert to numeric values, which *"1"* represent *"TRUE"* and *"0"* represent *"FALSE"*. This can also explain that logical variables can apply `mean()` function.

At the same time, although the `mean()` function consider the character in  `factor_ver` column and can not calculate the mean of the vectors, the levels in factor variables can also represent the character vectors. Additionally, levels can be represented by different numeric variables, this may explain why the factor variable can not be averaged, but can be converted to a numeric variable.

However, the character variables do not have levels, and can not be converted to numeric variables. In this case, `as.numeric` function will return NAs.
