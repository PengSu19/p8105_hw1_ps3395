## Problem 1

### Preparatory work

#### library packages

``` r
library(moderndive)
library(ggplot2)
```

#### Load the data

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
tail(early_january_weather, 3)
```

#### Dataset description

Above table shows the last 3 rows of the dataset
*‘early_january_weather’* which represent the hourly meterological data
for EWR for January 2013 with 15 columns and 358 rows.

The *‘early_january_weather’* dataset includes 15 variables such as:

- `origin`: The Weather station, in this dataset, it only contains
  `EWR`.
- `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`: The recording time.
- `temp`: The temperature in F, and the average temperature is 39.58
  (round to 2 decimal)

#### Scatterplot

``` r
scatter_plot <- ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(time_hour, temp, color = humid)) +
  geom_point()+
  xlab("Time_Hour")+
  ylab("Temperature")+
  theme_bw()
```

#### Scatter plot description

From scatter plot of temperature and time hour shows below, it is
noticeable that although there are significant and persistent
fluctuations in the temperature measured by weather station in January,
the overall trend for temperature is gradually increasing over the time,
and peaking after January 14 which reaches 57.92 degrees Fahrenheit.
Meanwhile, the relative humidity is relatively high from about January
12 to 14, which is shown as a light blue dots in Figure 1.
